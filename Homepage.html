	<p class="paragraph"><strong>I’m Cory.</strong> I have been writing and making videos about Vermont’s people and politics since 2014. I was born and raised in the Green Mountain State, and recently graduated from <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/">The University of Vermont</a> with a degree in Political Science. I’m currently based in Washington, D.C., completing <a href="https://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/259/master-of-professional-studies-in-journalism/">Georgetown University’s journalism master’s program</a>. Right now, I'm a reporter for the <a href="https://splc.org/">Student Press Law Center</a>.

	<br>

	Before ducking off and traveling Europe and the US this summer, (check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cory.dawson.54/">Instagram</a> for more) I was a reporter writing about Burlington, Vt. and Chittenden County, Vt. for <a href="https://vtdigger.org/">VTDigger.org</a>.

	<br>
	<br>

	Last year I covered Vermont’s legislative session for <a href="https://www.ap.org/en-us/">The Associated Press</a>, where my work was reprinted in major outlets all over the world. I was also the city reporter for <a href="https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/">The Burlington Free Press</a>, one of Vermont’s largest newspapers and before that, interned at VTDigger.

	<br>
	<br>

	As a student at UVM, I served as editor of one of the country’s top student newspapers, <a href="https://vtcynic.com/">The Vermont Cynic</a>.

	<br>
	<br>

	At UVM I regularly spoke in and assisted with journalism courses. During school and since graduating in 2016, I have worked with UVM associate professor Richard Watts, Ph.D. to design two classes on journalism and new media, Media-Policy-Action and Advanced Digital Storytelling.

	<br>
	<br>

	During the summer of 2015, I interned at the <a href="https://www.necir.org/">New England Center for Investigative Reporting</a>.
